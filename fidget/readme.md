* `state` provides the base classes to compare, manage, and store state in a fidget.
* `callables` creates function classes to logical conditions for functional programming.
* `objects` defines the module resolution order for a fidget.  Most specifically, it defines the logic for the `__getitem__` attribute to compose higher order functions.
* `model` defines the rest of the python data model to compose complex functions.  Most of the data model is defined except for `async` features.
